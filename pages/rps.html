        <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
        <div class=divider></div>

        <p>In this project you are going to be making a Rock, Paper, Scissors game and play against the computer.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: The player's turn</h3>

        <p>We need to start by getting an input from the player. We also need to validate what the player is entering to make sure they answer Rock, Paper or Scissors.</p>

        <pre><code class="python">#Get input from the player

#Check if Rock, Paper or Scissors
    #If not, ask again
</code></pre>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <pre><code class="python">player = False

while player == False:
    #Get input
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")

    #Check if valid input
    if player not in ["Rock","Paper","Scissors"]:
        print("Invalid Input, Check your spelling.")
        player = False</code></pre>

        <h3>Step 2: The computer's turn</h3>

        <p>Next we need the computer to also generate a random answer. We need to import the random module and use it to randomly choose an option.</p>

        <pre><code class="python">#Import the random module

#Create a list of options

#Randomly pick one of the options</code></pre>


<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="python">#This can go at the start of the program
import random

#Pick from a list of options
options = ["Rock","Paper","Scissors"]

computer = options[random.randint(0,2)]
</code></pre>


    <h3>Step 3: Add the logic</h3>

    <p>Now that we have our 2 inputs, we can add the logic to see who has won. We can do this with if, elif and else statements, comparing the player's answer to the computer's answer.</p>

    <pre><code class="python">#Check for a tie

#Player inputs Rock
    #Check against Paper and Scissors

#Player inputs Paper
    #Check against Rock and Scissors

#Player inputs Scissors
    #Check against Rock and Paper</code></pre>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">if player == computer:
    print("Tie!")
elif player == "Rock":
    if computer == "Paper":
        print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
    else:
        print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
elif player == "Paper":
    if computer == "Scissors":
        print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
    else:
        print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
else:
    if computer == "Rock":
        print("You lose!", computer, "smashes", player)
    else:
        print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
    </code></pre>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>That's the main game and logic done, however there are some more features we can add to improve the game.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Play again?</h3>

    <p>The first thing we can go is to see if the player wants to play again. We can do this by combining a while loop with asking the player if they want to play again.</p>

    <pre><code class="python">#Create initial play variable

#While loop while that variable is True

    #The gameplay code

    #Ask if the player wants to play again
        #If not, end the loop by changing the play variable</code></pre>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">play = True

#Loop while they want to play
while play == True:

    #Add the gameplay code...


    #Get player input
    again = input("Do you want to play again? (Yes/No)")
    if again == "No":
        play = False</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 5: Scoring the player</h3>

    <p>As the player could be playing multiple times, we can keep track of how many times they've won. This can be done with a score variable which you increment after every win.</p>

    <pre><code class="python">#Create inital score variable

#Update score every time they win

#After every game, output their score.</code></pre>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">score = 0

    #Inside the game code:
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
            score = score + 1
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
            score = score + 1
    else:
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose!", computer, "smashes", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
            score = score + 1

    #Add to play again code
    if again == "No":
        play = False
    else:
        #Output score
        print("Your current score is",score)

#After the game is finished
print("Your final score was",score)</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Step 6: Highscores</h3>

    <p>Now that we have a scoring mechanism, we can save scores to a file so people can compete with eachother for the highscore. Adding highscores can be split into 2 sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Loading the current highscore.</p></li>
        <li><p>Saving the players score and comparing it to the highscore when they are finished.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
    <pre><code class="python">#At the start of the code
    #Open scores file
    #Extract and parse current highscore

#At the end of the code
    #Compare players score against the current highscore
        #If it's higher, update the current highscore in the file</code></pre>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">#Open the highscore file
file = open("highscore.txt","r")

#Extract highscore
highscore = file.read().split(",")

#Don't forget to close the file
file.close()

if highscore != ['']:
    #Output the current highscore
    print("The current highscore is",highscore[1],"held by",highscore[0])
else:
    #If noone has played yet, create a default highscore
    highscore = ["",-1]


#...game code...


#Don't forget to convert the highscore to an integer
if score > int(highscore[1]):
    print("You beat the highscore.")
    #Update high score
    name = input("What is your name?")
    
    highscore = [name,str(score)]

#Write the current highscore to the file
file = open("highscore.txt","w")

#Turn the highscore into a string
highscore = ",".join(highscore)

file.write(highscore)

#Don't forget to close the file
file.close()</code></pre>

    <div class="divider"></div>
    <h2>The final code:</h2>

    <p>After putting everything together the final code should look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">#Import the random module
import random

#Open the highscore file
file = open("highscore.txt","r")

#Extract highscore
highscore = file.read().split(",")

#Don't forget to close the file
file.close()

if highscore != ['']:
    #Output the current highscore
    print("The current highscore is",highscore[1],"held by",highscore[0])
else:
    #If noone has played yet, create a default highscore
    highscore = ["",-1]


play = True
score = 0

#Loop while they want to play
while play == True:
    player = False

    while player == False:
        #Get input
        player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")

        #Check if valid input
        if player not in ["Rock","Paper","Scissors"]:
            print("Invalid Input, Check your spelling.")
            player = False

    #Pick from a list of options
    options = ["Rock","Paper","Scissors"]

    computer = options[random.randint(0,2)]

    #Compare player vs computer
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
            score = score + 1
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
            score = score + 1
    else:
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose!", computer, "smashes", player)
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
            score = score + 1

    #Get player input
    again = input("Do you want to play again? (Yes/No)")
    if again == "No":
        play = False
    else:
        #Output score
        print("Your current score is",score)

#After the game is finished
print("Your final score was",score)

#Don't forget to convert the highscore to an integer
if score > int(highscore[1]):
    print("You beat the highscore.")
    #Update high score
    name = input("What is your name?")

    highscore = [name,str(score)]

#Write the current highscore to the file
file = open("highscore.txt","w")

#Turn the highscore into a string
highscore = ",".join(highscore)

file.write(highscore)

#Don't forget to close the file
file.close()</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 7: Customise</h3>
    <p>The main game might be finished, but that doesn't mean the coding has to end. Here are a few things to try:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Change up scoring.</strong> Score 1 point for drawing and 2 points for winning.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Change up highscores.</strong> Try adding the top 3 scores to the game instead of a single highscore.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Feeling artsy.</strong> Add some ascii art to the game, for example using <span>O</span>, <span>___</span> and <span>>8</span> for symbols.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Feeling creative.</strong> Create a new alternative to Rock, Paper, Scissors. For example: <span>Fire, Logs, Water</span></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Feeling technical.</strong> Add more options to the game, implement <span>Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.</span></p></li>
    </ul>
